To-do List

Video Demo:  <URL HERE>

Description:
I created a to-do list website that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows you to create tasks, cross them off, uncross them off, and delete them. The tasks are saved to your browser if you refresh the page. 
Although it is a pretty simple concept of an application, I still learnt more JavaScript and became more comfortable with new syntax. As well, I dove deeper in CSS and found new resources that I can use in the future. 

In my HTML file, I made the choice of leaving out my JavaScript and linking it to itsown file. I knew all of the commands of the task buttons would be run through JS, and I didn't want to bulk up my HTML file too much. At first, for the list of tasks that I created, I made it in the HTML file with the <ul> and <li>, but I knew that I needed to use JS for the controls. I left that in as a comment. 

In my CSS file, I first set the whole page's design. Then I did a lot of research of different styles; how to round the buttons and colour codes. I found images online as png files to add. I had to figure out how to change the colour of sections when they are hovered over too. I picked a light gradient of greens for the background, because I didn't want anything too distracting from the main task. 

For the JavaScript file, I did a lot of research on buttons and found a lot of great tutorials on youtube. I liked being able to check and uncheck the boxes. I didn't want to have the tasks disappear once they are checked incase it was a mistake by the user. So I added the 'x' button to delete the tasks only by control of the user. 

I had to research how to save data to a local server using JavaScript and how to display the data whenever I open the website. Which was a good skill to learn and suprisingly easy.
I also researched how to use GitHub and how to push code to GitHub. This was the part I struggled with the most, but I feel that I learnt a lot and gained more confidence in using GitHub. 
I think in the furture, once I develop more skills and feel more confident, I would create a page similar to what I made. But I would add other components for studying, like a timer and other applications that would keep the user focused on their tasks.
