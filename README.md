To-do List
Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
Description:
I created a to-do list website that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows you to create tasks, cross them off, uncross them off, and delete them. The tasks are saved to your browser if you refresh the page. 
In my html file, 
I had to research how to save data to a local server using JavaScript and how to display the data whenever I open the website. 
I also researched how to use GitHub and how to push code to GitHub. This was the part I struggled with the most, but I feel that I learnt a lot and gained more confidence in using GitHub. 
Although it is a pretty simple concept of an application, I still learnt more JavaScript and became more comfortable with new syntax. As well, I dove deeper in CSS and found new resources that I can use in the future.
